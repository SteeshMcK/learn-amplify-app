Simple create-react-app used to learn deployment using AWS Amplify

So far...  
1. ~Create a React App~  
2. ~Initialize GitHub Repository~    
3. ~Log into AWS Management Console~  
4. ~Deploy app with AWS Amplify~
5. ~Initialize a Local Amplify App~
6. ~Install the Amplify Libraries (Authorization)~
7. Create a GraphQL API and Database

"Record Screech"! Uh oh, AWS stopped co-operating at the beginning of creating the GraphQL API. I've had trouble running and deploying for a while with this app and I think it has to do with a confusion between WSL and Bash. I think I installed the app in WSL and configured in Bash or something. Not entirely sure. ANYWAY... started over again, installing and configuring and running and pushing using Git Bash exclusively. So far, everything is running peachy keen, jelly bean. That repo can be found [here](https://github.com/SteeshMcK/learn-amplify-take-two)
